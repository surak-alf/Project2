Solar Energy Performance Analysis for Benin, Sierra Leon, and Togo in 2022
The purpose of this paper is to present the findings from an analysis of three African nations' solar energy performance: Togo, Sierra Leone, and Benin. 
The dataset, which was gathered over the course of 2022, includes significant characteristics such as radiation levels, module outputs, temperature, humidity, wind patterns, and maintenance procedures. 
I have summed up the solar energy landscape in these places by looking at these elements over the specified time period. 
Although the data was first analyzed annually, the findings were the same for both halves of the year. 
The data was then separated into quarterly periods to obtain more detailed insights. This breakdown each quarter serves as the basis for the study and report that follow.

Seasonal differences in solar radiation were seen in all three countries, according to the examination of solar radiation patterns. 
Due to longer daylight hours and higher solar angles, solar radiation rose throughout the first and second quarters. 
On the other hand, as the days got shorter in the third and fourth quarters, radiation levels dropped. 
Togo displayed significant unusual variances, especially in the fourth quarter, while Benin and Sierra Leone typically displayed comparable trends. 
ModA and ModB, which represent the module's output and performance, varied during the course of the year. 
When compared to Benin, Sierra Leone continuously produced more modules, which may indicate higher module efficiency. 
There were times where times when Togoâ€™s module produced more and times when it produce less.

Overall, a number of variables, such as solar radiation, temperature, humidity, wind patterns, and maintenance procedures, affected Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo's solar energy performance in 2022. 
Even though Sierra Leon continuously produced more modules, all three nations faced seasonal fluctuations as well as difficulties with weather and system upkeep. 
According to the data, Sierra Leon seems to be the best place for a business to launch a solar panel venture. Sierra Leone produced more modules than Benin and Togo, which leads to this result. 
This suggests a possibly more suitable climate for the production of solar energy. Despite having somewhat lower amounts of solar radiation than Benin, Sierra Leone and Benin have comparable seasonal trends. 
This suggests that consistent solar energy generation throughout the year might still be advantageous for Moon Light Energy Solution Company in Sierra Leon.
