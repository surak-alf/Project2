## Solar Energy Performance Analysis for Benin, Sierra Leon, and Togo in 2022

This repository presents the findings of a comprehensive analysis of solar energy performance in three West African nations: Togo, Sierra Leone, and Benin. 
The dataset, collected throughout 2022, includes key parameters such as solar radiation, module outputs, temperature, humidity, wind patterns, and maintenance practices.

## Data Description
•	Timestamp (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm): Date and time of each observation.

•	GHI (W/m²): Global Horizontal Irradiance, the total solar radiation received per square meter on a horizontal surface.

•	DNI (W/m²): Direct Normal Irradiance, the amount of solar radiation received per square meter on a surface perpendicular to the rays of the sun.

•	DHI (W/m²): Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance, solar radiation received per square meter on a horizontal surface that does not arrive on a direct path from the sun.

•	ModA (W/m²): Measurements from a module or sensor (A), similar to irradiance.

•	ModB (W/m²): Measurements from a module or sensor (B), similar to irradiance.

•	Tamb (°C): Ambient Temperature in degrees Celsius.

•	RH (%): Relative Humidity as a percentage of moisture in the air.

•	WS (m/s): Wind Speed in meters per second.

•	WSgust (m/s): Maximum Wind Gust Speed in meters per second.

•	WSstdev (m/s): Standard Deviation of Wind Speed, indicating variability.

•	WD (°N (to east)): Wind Direction in degrees from north.

•	WDstdev: Standard Deviation of Wind Direction, showing directional variability.

•	BP (hPa): Barometric Pressure in hectopascals.

•	Cleaning (1 or 0): Signifying whether cleaning (possibly of the modules or sensors) occurred.

•	Precipitation (mm/min): Precipitation rate measured in millimeters per minute.

•	TModA (°C): Temperature of Module A in degrees Celsius.

•	TModB (°C): Temperature of Module B in degrees Celsius.



## Key Findings:

Seasonal Variations: All three countries experienced distinct seasonal patterns in solar radiation. 
Higher radiation levels were observed during the first and second quarters due to longer daylight hours and higher solar angles. 
Conversely, radiation levels decreased in the third and fourth quarters as daylight hours shortened.

Module Performance: Module outputs varied among the three countries. Sierra Leone consistently produced more modules than Benin, potentially indicating higher module efficiency. 
Togo displayed more variability in module output, with periods of higher and lower production.

Impact of Environmental Factors: Solar radiation, temperature, humidity, wind patterns, and maintenance procedures all influenced solar energy performance in the three countries. 
Despite seasonal fluctuations and challenges related to weather and system upkeep, Sierra Leone emerged as a promising location for solar energy ventures.

## Data and Analysis:

The dataset is organized into quarterly periods for detailed insights.
Data analysis techniques (e.g., statistical analysis, visualization) were employed to identify trends and patterns.

## Future Directions:

Expanded Analysis: Investigate the impact of specific environmental factors on solar energy performance in greater detail.

Policy Recommendations: Propose policies and strategies to optimize solar energy utilization in the region.

Predictive Modeling: Develop models to forecast solar energy generation based on historical data and weather predictions.
